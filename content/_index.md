# Hi, I'm Dominic Leung.

I'm currently a developer focusing on web applications and data-related infrastructure.

I received my M.Phil degree in Risk Management Science from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Keith Chan](https://sites.google.com/site/kwchankeith/). My degree covers **statistics** and **programming**.

I combine methods from **statistics**, **programming**, **data management** to enable effective methods for data analysis and model building.

This page serves as a personal space to share my learning journey and experiences in the field of software development and data science.
